# [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) website

This website is built using markdown, and a few line ruby script.

## Local Build Quick-start Guide
- Install the required dependencies: `ruby`, and the `redcarpet` and `rouge` gems. 
- If you have ruby, you can install `redcarpet` and `rouge` with `gem install redcarpet rouge`.
- Run `site.rb`. It should generate `index.html`, which can be opened directly in your browser.
