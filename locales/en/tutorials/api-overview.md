# API Overview

### This is a work in progress.

Here we provide some resources and explanation to some API and aspects of Lite XL.
For API docs, it's available in [the repo](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/tree/master/docs).
Thus, we'll not explain _everything_, only the more important and frequently used features.

Built-in APIs:

- [Process API](/tutorials/overview/process)
- [System API](/tutorials/overview/system)
- [Regex API](/tutorials/overview/regex)
